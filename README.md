#### This project is a UI for the webapp application for CSC-480 cource, my senior year project. This react UI has two functionality. The first functionality displays products, which are products from src/data.json. The other functionality is filtering through products and display found products.

Once cloned, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
